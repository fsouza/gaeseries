.. note:: There is an `ongoing discussion
          <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.web2py/8538/focus=8633>`_,
          on whether this part of the *web2py* documents should be
          included in the developer documentation.

          This discussion involves:

          * the `AlterEgo (FAQ) <http://www.web2py.com/AlterEgo>`_
          * the `User Wiki <https://mdp.cti.depaul.edu/wiki>`_

          Until this is resolved, the parts under question will be excluded.

          Nevertheless, these party are still available and can be included in
          the Sphinx build by the following steps:

          #. back up the directory ``web2py/doc``
          #. unzip the archive ``external_input.zip`` delivered with the
             documentation in the directory
             ``web2py/doc``.
             Existing files should be overwritten.
          #. re-build the documentation
